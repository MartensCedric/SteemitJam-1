IDEAS SteemitJam
Theme : Protect it

IDEA 1 : Flock Protector
Flock behavior -> protecting blue crystal...
Cargo must be protected until destination...

Enemies swarm and target a certain object. The player must defend the object with fuzzy controls.

Things that the player can interact -> Magnet/Repulsor ->Pulls/Pushes enemies...?

Different units with different velocity and acceleration?

Pros : Should not be too hard to do
Cons : Looks boring

IDEA 2 : Stop Trump/Kimg Jung Un for reaching the nuke button

A nuke button is placed at the center of the screen. 
The player only sees the twitter feed of both Kim Jung Un and Donald J. Trump.
The player can only protect the nuclear button for a very short amount of time, he must read their tweets and make sure
it's protects when one of them decides to press the button.

The nuke button can be temporarily deactivated but it raises heat and you may get fired?

The leaders can share text messages, retweet other messages and share images.

Different types of messages :
A message stating something
Followed by a counter message?

EX : "My nuke button is always on my desk."
"Mine is bigger"

Pro : Funny, original. Not too hard to do.
Cons : Needs a lot of dialog on Trump and KJU. Will be art heavy and my art sucks lets be honest.

one main unanswered question : "What makes sense in you protecting the nuke button? And how do you protect it?"

Electricity system?
